# notifo-client

Client for Notifo, written in Kotlin and Java.

[Notifo](https://github.com/aksel/notifo) is a WIP cross-platform notification/reminder/memo application.

I have decided to try out Kotlin for the desktop application client. My main motivation for choosing Kotlin, is that I think it looks like a very interesting language. As SocketIO has a Java client, I think I could make this work.
With Kotlin now being officially supported for Android, I think a lot of the functionality of this app can be reused for apps - another benefit.
